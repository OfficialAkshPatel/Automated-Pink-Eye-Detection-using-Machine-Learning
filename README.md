# Automated-Pink-Eye-Detection-using-Machine-Learning

Problem Statement:



Pink eye, also known as conjunctivitis, is a common eye condition that can be caused by various factors including bacterial or viral infections, allergies, or irritants. Early detection and treatment of pink eye are crucial to prevent its spread and ensure timely medical intervention. However, diagnosing pink eye can be challenging, especially in its early stages, and it often relies on the subjective judgment of healthcare professionals.

The aim of this machine learning project is to develop an automated pink eye detection system that can accurately identify the presence of pink eye in individuals based on images of their eyes. This system will assist healthcare providers in making faster and more objective diagnoses, leading to improved patient care and reduced transmission of contagious forms of pink eye.


Objectives:

Data Collection: Gather a diverse dataset of eye images, including both healthy and pink eye-affected eyes. These images should cover a wide range of ages, ethnicities, and eye conditions to ensure model generalization.

Data Preprocessing: Clean and preprocess the image data to enhance its quality and prepare it for machine learning algorithms. This may involve resizing, normalization, and data augmentation techniques.

Model Development: Build a machine learning model, such as a convolutional neural network (CNN), capable of accurately classifying eye images as either healthy or exhibiting pink eye symptoms. Experiment with different model architectures and hyperparameters to achieve the best performance.

Model Evaluation: Evaluate the model's performance using appropriate metrics, such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Ensure that the model can reliably distinguish between different forms of pink eye and avoid false positives.

Interpretability: Develop methods to interpret the model's predictions, highlighting the areas in the image that contributed most to the diagnosis. This will enhance the model's transparency and trustworthiness for healthcare professionals.

User Interface: Create a user-friendly interface that allows healthcare providers to upload eye images for analysis and receive automated pink eye diagnosis results. The interface should be designed for easy integration into clinical workflows.

Validation and Deployment: Validate the model on an independent dataset and fine-tune it as necessary. Once the model demonstrates robust performance, deploy it in a real-world healthcare setting, ensuring compliance with relevant regulations and data privacy standards.

Continuous Improvement: Implement a mechanism for continuous model improvement and updates as new data becomes available or as the model's performance can be further enhanced.
