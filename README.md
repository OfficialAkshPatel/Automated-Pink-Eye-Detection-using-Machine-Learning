# Automated-Pink-Eye-Detection-using-Machine-Learning

##Problem Statement:



Pink eye, also known as conjunctivitis, is a common eye condition that can be caused by various factors including bacterial or viral infections, allergies, or irritants. Early detection and treatment of pink eye are crucial to prevent its spread and ensure timely medical intervention. However, diagnosing pink eye can be challenging, especially in its early stages, and it often relies on the subjective judgment of healthcare professionals.

The aim of this machine learning project is to develop an automated pink eye detection system that can accurately identify the presence of pink eye in individuals based on images of their eyes. This system will assist healthcare providers in making faster and more objective diagnoses, leading to improved patient care and reduced transmission of contagious forms of pink eye.
